# Revisions and the Cloud 

The three main topic I will be discussing in todays notes are Version Control, History of GIT, and Workflow.

Version Control falls under three categories Local, Centralized and Distributed. Local Version Control is just the information on your hard disk that is locally stored in your machine. Centralized Version Control is files or a set of files stored into a server mostly used for collaboration. The last Verison Control is Distributed and it address the major vulnerability of the CVS. If a CVS goes down collaborators will not be able to work with each other or save changes.

The history of GIT started with an open source software project call Linux kernel. The developers started with Distributed Version Control called BitKeeper. Bitkeeper was too slow so GIT took over and made a faster more up to date process that most developers still use today.

The last Topic of discussion is Workflow. The three steps of workflow are Add, Commit, and Post. The add step is putting in the information you wish to change to your file. The commit step is the points to the most recent commit. The post step is sending it to GIT and also describing what you did in the add step.
